## What is Horizon?

Horizon solves a real problem. Migrant workers send $800 billion per year back home. Traditional services like Western Union charge 3–7% fees and take 1–3 days. Horizon uses the Stellar blockchain to make it instant and nearly free.

**Example:** Joy works in Dubai and wants to send money to his mother in Mumbai.
- Traditional: Rs.200–500 fee, 1–3 days
- Horizon: Rs.1.80 fee (0.1 XLM), 5–10 seconds

---

## Problem Statement
 
Every month, millions of migrant workers send money home to their families across borders. The current reality:
 
| Problem | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| Bank transfer fee | ₹150–500 per transfer |
| Transfer time | 1–3 business days |
| No bank account access | 1.4 billion people unbanked worldwide |
| Western Union / MoneyGram | 5–8% fee deducted from poor families |
| Hidden exchange rate cuts | Additional 2–3% loss |
 
**Horizon solves this.** Send money in under 10 seconds for less than ₹2 — no bank account required.
 
---
 
## Solution
 
Horizon is a mobile-first cross-border remittance dApp built on Stellar Blockchain:
 
- Sender scans receiver's QR code → sends money in under 10 seconds
- Receiver gets instant in-app notification and sees balance in local currency
- Pay anyone by scanning their QR code
- Withdraw cash from ATM using a 6-digit code
- No bank account needed — no crypto knowledge required
- Fee: Less than ₹2 per transfer

- Toggle available on the Send page: `Gasless Transfer (Fee Sponsored)`
- Implemented via `StellarSdk.TransactionBuilder.buildFeeBumpTransaction()`

## Data Indexing
 
Horizon uses **Stellar Horizon REST API** for data indexing:
 
| Endpoint | Usage |
|----------|-------|
| `GET /accounts/{address}` | Fetch wallet balance |
| `GET /accounts/{address}/payments` | Transaction history |
| `GET /accounts/{address}/transactions` | Full transaction list |
| `POST /transactions` | Submit signed transaction |
 
Base URL: `https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org`
 
---

## Transaction Flow

```
1. Sender selects receiver
   → Search by name (from registered users)
   → Scan QR code with camera
   → Paste Stellar wallet address

2. Sender enters amount in their local currency
   → e.g., 100 AED

3. App converts using live rates
   → 100 AED = 27.20 USD = 247.27 XLM

4. Sender confirms and clicks Send
   → Freighter wallet signs the transaction
   → Submitted to Stellar Testnet

5. Settlement in 5–10 seconds

6. Receiver gets notified within 8 seconds
   → Red badge on History tab
   → Toast popup: "Money Received! +247.27 XLM"

7. Sender gets receipt
   → Shows all transfer details
   → Save as image or share on WhatsApp
```
